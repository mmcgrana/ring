# Ring

Ring is a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack. By abstracting the details of HTTP into a simple, unified API, Ring allows web applications to be constructed of modular components that can be shared among a variety of applications, web servers, and web frameworks.

The `SPEC` file at the root of this distribution for provides a complete description of the Ring interface.

## Synopsis

"Hello World" in Ring:

    (use 'ring.adapter.jetty)

    (defn app [req]
      {:status  200
       :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
       :body    "Hello World from Ring"})

    (run-jetty app {:port 8080})

Adding simple middleware:

    (defn wrap-upcase [app]
      (fn [req]
        (let [orig-resp (app req)]
          (assoc orig-resp :body (.toUpperCase (:body orig-resp))))))

    (def upcase-app (wrap-upcase app))

    (run-jetty upcase-app {:port 8080})

## Quick Start

To see some working examples, first pull in Ring's dependencies using [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen):

Add the following dependency to your project.clj:
  
    [ring/ring-jetty-adapter "0.3.11"] ;; or latest version

Then run:

    $ lein deps

To see a live "Hello World" Ring app, run:

    $ java -cp "lib/*" clojure.main example/hello_world.clj

Now visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser; the Ring app will respond to your request with a simple HTML page indicating the time of day.

To see a more sophisticated Ring app, run:

    $ java -cp "lib/*" clojure.main example/wrapping.clj

* If you request `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser the `ring.handler.dump` handler will respond with an HTML page representing the request map that it received (see the `SPEC` for details on the request map).
* If you request `http://localhost:8080/clojure.png`, the `ring.middleware.file` middleware will detect that there is a `clojure.png` file in the app's `public` directory and return that image as a response.
* If you request `http://localhost:8080/error`, the app will produce an error that will be caught by the `ring.middleware.stacktrace` middleware, which will in turn return a readable stacktrace as the HTML response.

## Leiningen Usage

To include one of the above libraries in your Leiningen project, for example `ring-core`, add the following to your `:dependencies`:

    [ring/ring-core "1.0.0-RC5"]

To include all of them, add:

    [ring "1.0.0-RC5"]

## Development

Ring is being actively developed; you can track its progress on the [GitHub page](http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring) page and on the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/ring-clojure).

To submit a patch, please post your corresponding GitHub branch to the Ring Google Group. This allows your changes to be seen and discussed by all Ring developers. If you are attempting something substantial, consider posting to the Google Group first with your idea.

To run the Ring unit tests, first navigate to the appropriate project and then:

    $ lein deps
    $ lein test
